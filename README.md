# BookStore
a full-stack e-commerce website (Book Store). 
Using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. HTML5 has been used to structure the website using all appropriate tags and elements.
To style, the website CSS3 has been used with all the appropriate fonts and colour schemes. For the Front-End functionality and validation, JavaScript functions have been used.
And the Back-End PHP is used to set the connection to the MySQL database store customer card details into the database. The overall design is minimalist focused on the content.
